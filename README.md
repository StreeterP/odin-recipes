# odin-recipes
The Odin Project Recipes Project. An html only web page.
In this project I will create an HTML only recipes web page utilizing git and github for version control.

END NOTES:                                                  I opted for the larger text size of the h2 tag instead of using the list tags option for my index.html recipe links. To make the index.html look a little better I added a clickable link of The Odin Project logo that links to TOP website on a new separate page and some hr line tags. I added a link in the kouignettes description to a wiki page. There is a link in the dolmas recipe html for the tzatziki recipe html.
If I did it all over again I would have brushed up better on relative paths before I started. My lacking in this area cost me some time in needless commits/pushes and rewriting my paths in code editor.
