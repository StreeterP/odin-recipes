    <h4>Dolma is a family of stuffed dishes associated with Ottoman (Turkish) cuisine. Typically made with a filling of rice, minced meat, seafood, fruit, or any combination inside a vegetable or leaf wrapping. Wrapped dolma are known specifically as sarma, made by rolling grape, cabbage, or other leaves around the filling. Dolma can be served warm or at room temperature.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A 16oz jar of grape leaves, about 60 to 70</li><br>
        <li>One and a half cups short grain rice rinsed and soaked for 15 minutes or more then drained</li><br>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil or EVOO as the abbreviators like to say</li><br>
        <li>One large yellow onion finely chopped</li><br>
        <li>12 oz lean ground meat</li><br>
        <li>Kosher salt</li><br>
        <li>Black pepper</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp allspice</li><br>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li><br>
        <li>1/2 cup each of chopped fresh parsley, dill, and mint</li><br>
        <li>Two tomatoes sliced</li><br>
        <li>About 4 1/4 cups of low sodium chicken or vegetable broth</li><br>
        <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li><br>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the leaves from the jar and gently rinse well. Place in colander to drain. Don't discard ripped or ugly looking leaves (they'll be used later).</li><br>
        <li>Soak rice for 15 to 20 minutes while you make the stuffing mixture.</li><br>
        <li>Heat 1 tbs EVOO in a large skillet. Add onions and cook until soft and translucent about 2 minutes. Add the meat and brown. Remove from heat and drain excess fat. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the spices then salt and pepper to taste.</li><br>
        <li>Add drained rice and fresh herbs to meat and onion mixture. Add a generous drizzle of the EVOO and mix.</li><br>
        <li>Prepare a large and lidded cooking pot (I use one large enough for a dinner plate to fit in) by brushing the inside with EVOO. Arrange two or three layers of grape leaves on the bottom (use the torn and ugly ones). Layer the sliced tomatoes on top of the leaves. </li><br>
        <li>With a pair of sharp scissors cut off leaf stem and lay leaf flat on your work surface. Place one heaping tsp of the filling in the center of leaf, fold over sides of leaf and roll like a burrito or egg roll. Do this one leaf at a time until you run out of leaves or filling.  </li><br>
        <li>Arrange the rolled leaves seam side down in the pot to cover the circumference of bottom. Layer the remaining stuffed leaves in pot the same way. Place a plate or other heat and food safe weight on top of the rolled leaves that will keep them from floating and coming apart.</li><br>
        <li>Boil the broth and pour over the leaves until just covered. You'll have leftover broth but extra is better than not enough. Cover with lid and cook over medium heat for 35 minutes. Uncover and remove the plate, then pour in the lemon juice. Cover again without the plate and continue cooking on low for 30 to 45 minutes or until fully cooked.</li><br>
      </ol> 
      <h2>To Serve</h2>
      <ol> 
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool for 20 or 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer to serving platter and drizzle with EVOO.</li><br>
        <li>Serve with a side of<a href="tzatziki.html" alt="tzatziki sauce recipe link"> Tzatziki Sauce</a> and wedges of lemon.</li>
