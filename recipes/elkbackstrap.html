    <h4>The backstrap is the long strips of muscle that start at the shoulder blades on deer, elk, moose, antelope and other animals that runs down the length of the spine all the way to the final vertebrae. Backstrap isn't as good as the tenderloin located in the inner cavity along the spine but it's a very close second and more plentiful.</h4>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>12 to 16oz elk backstrap (deer, moose, antelope, or whatever is available, beef works too)</li><br>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li><br>
        <li>1 tablespoon lard</li><br>
        <li>1/2 pound cremini mushrooms sliced</li><br>
        <li>3 tbs salted butter divided</li><br>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li><br>
        <li>3 or 4 cloves of garlic smashed</li><br>
        <li>3/4 cup of red wine (I usually use a Chianti)</li><br>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pat steak dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper.</li><br>
        <li>Heat cast iron skillet on just under medium high heat. Once hot but not smoking add the lard and swirl to coat pan.</li><br>
        <li>Place steak into pan and cook for 4 minutes or until you have a nice crust on the bottom of the steak.</li><br>
        <li>Flip the steak, smashed garlic and 2 tbs butter. Continue to cook for about 4 more minutes spooning the melted butter continuously over the steak while cooking. You're shooting for about 115 degrees F internal temperature. </li><br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Remove the steak and let rest 10 minutes loosely tented in foil. DON'T SKIP THIS!!!</li><br>
        <li>While the steak is resting add the mushrooms to your hot pan. Cook for about 4 or 5 minutes or until almost all the liquid has been released and cooked off. </li><br>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tbs salted butter and rosemary sprigs to mushrooms. Cook and stir for about 1 minute more.</li><br>
        <li>While stirring mushrooms add the red wine and cook for 4 or 5 minutes, or until the wine has reduced and there is a small amount of sauce left in the pan. Taste the mushrooms for seasoning and adjust if needed. There may have been enough from the butter and what was left in the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Slice the steak into 1/2 inch slices and serve with mushrooms on top. Drizzle with pan sauce and enjoy!</li><br>
