    <h4>Kouign-amann is a sweet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretons">Breton</a> bread made with butter laminated dough. It is a multi layered round pastry containing layers of butter and incorporated sugar, similar to a puff pastry with fewer layers. Slowly baked until the sugar caramelizes and the butter expands the dough. A smaller version you may find in bakeries is called a Kouignette. Kouignette is similar to a muffin shaped carmelized croissant.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Dough</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (whatever temp range your yeast calls for)</li><br>
        <li>1 tbs white sugar</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li><br>
        <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour divided (you need a high protein flour like bread flour for best results)</li><br>
        <li>2 tbs melted butter or more as needed</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher salt</li><br>
        <li>2 sticks ice cold butter (put in freezer for about an hour)</li><br>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the Seasoned Sugar</h3>
      <ul>  
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li><br>
        <li>2 teaspoons Kosher or sea salt</li><br>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Let bloom for about 5 minutes until foamy. If it doesn't get foamy your yeast is probably bad (don't worry it happens but you'll need new yeast).</li><br>
        <li>After your yeast gets nice and foamy add 2 cups of the bread flour, 1 tbs melted butter and salt. Stir with a sturdy spoon until a very wet sticky dough is formed.</li><br>
        <li>Dust your clean work surface with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Turn the dough out onto floured surface and knead, folding in the excess flour until a soft, slightly sticky, and elastic dough forms. Form a round (like shaping a boule loaf) and place into a well buttered/greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li><br>
        <li>Mix together the salt and sugar for your seasoned sugar. Taste and adjust with more salt or sugar if desired.</li><br>
        <li>Brush a 12 cup muffin tin with the remaining 1tbs melted butter. Over a pan to catch the excess, spoon some seasoned sugar into each cup and shake to coat. Turn over muffin tin and catch the excess in your pan. Return the excess seasoned sugar to your bowl of seasoned sugar. Set the muffin tin aside until needed.</li><br>
        <li>Place dough onto your clean floured surface and gently press into a rough rectangle shape. Roll the dough into a 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick rectangle. Grate one stick of the ice cold butter over the dough leaving a 1 inch border free of butter. Flour your hands and gently press the butter into the dough with your fingers (fingers don't melt butter like palms do). Fold the dough rectangle widthwise into thirds. Press gently to square out the edges but don't worry about being perfect, being fast enough as not to let the butter melt is more important. Place on a lightly greased or silicon lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Again roll the dough into a large 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick rectangle, pull and stretch the corners as needed to square up edges. As before grate the remaining stick of ice cold butter over the dough leaving the 1 inch border free of butter. With floured hands gently press the butter into the dough with fingers. Fold into thirds then roll down to a 1/8 to 1/4 inch rectangle again. Repeat rolling and folding one more time then place dough back on pan, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. </li><br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of remaining seasoned sugar onto your work surface. Place dough on sugar and sprinkle a little more on top. Roll into a large 1/8 to 1/4 in rectangle, turning and topping with more sugar between rolls.</li><br>
        <li>Use a pizza cutter or very sharp knife to trim all sides of rectangle and even up the edges (save the trimmings to form and cook with the rest of the dough).</li><br>
        <li>Cut the dough into 12 equal squares. Sprinkle more seasoned sugar on top. Lightly pinch the corners of the squares into the center to make a crown shape, place into the prepared muffin tin. Repeat with remaining squares and sprinkle more sugar on top. Rest dough in tins for 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Place muffin tin on a baking sheet and your formed trimmings. Bake in the preheated oven until brown and puffed, around 30 minutes. Transfer muffins from tin to a cooling wrack while still hot (if caramelized sugar sets in tin you'll have problems). Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li><br>
