    <h4>Tzatziki is a class of dip, soup, or sauce found in the cuisines of Southeastern Europe and West Asia. It is made of salted strained yogurt or diluted yogurt mixed with cucumber, garlic, salt, olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, and herbs such as dill, mint, parsley, and thyme. It is served cold as a side dish, an appetizer, or a sauce.</h4>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2/3 English cucumber, striped (partially peeled)</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher salt, divided </li><br>
        <li>5 or 6 garlic cloves peeled and grated</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li><br>
        <li>1 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)</li><br>
        <li>2 cups plain Greek yogurt</li><br>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill, mint, or a mixture of the two</li><br>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 tsp ground pepper</li><br>
      </ul>    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Grate the cucumber and toss with 1/2 tsp of Kosher salt. Let sit 5 minutes then place into the center of a triple layer of cheesecloth. Pull up corners of the cheesecloth making a sack of cucumber and twist to extract as much liquid as possible (there will be a lot of liquid).</li><br>
        <li>In a large bowl add garlic, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, white vinegar, EVOO and stir. Add the grated drained cucumber, yogurt, pepper, fresh herbs, and stir to combine well.</li><br>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. The longer you refrigerate the more the flavors will meld (I try for at least 4 hours).</li><br>
        <li>When ready to serve re stir and transfer to serving vessel. Drizzle with EVOO and serve with your favorite veggies, pita chips or wedges, gyros, souvlaki, dolma, etc.</li><br>
      </ol>
